# Credit Risk Classification
# Machine Learning Model Performance Report 


## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis aims to develop and assess the accurancy of a data model intended to predict the creditworthiness of potential borrowers using peer-to-peer lending services. 

## Results:
-Balanced Accurancy Score: 95.2%
    -This score reflects the model's overall prediciton accuracy, accounting for both sensitivity (recall or true positive rate) and specifically (true negative rate). The model achieved a balanced accuracy of 95.2%

-Precision Score: 85%
    -This indicates that 85% of the positive outcomes predicted by the model were correct.
    
-Recall Score: 91%
    -The model demonstarted 91% accuracy in identifying true positives out of all actual positive cases. 

## Summary:
-In summary, the model performed strongly, achieving high precision, recall, and accuracy for both classes. It demonstrates an almost perfect ability to differentiate the two classes, with class 0 being predicited with slightly better accuracy and precision than class 1.
